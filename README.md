How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The first step is to collect as many user requirements as possible, either by phone, e-mail or face-to-face meetings, and then create “user stories”. Based on the user stories, create a project plan. During the process of gathering user requirements, you should use your own experience to determine the user's focus based on rounds of negotiation to choose the best solution.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Gather information - Communicate with team - Determine project plan - Identify issues, make adjustments - Sprint - Release - Review
I think the daily stand meeting is important and useful, it's a place to identify issues and solve problems.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a member of an agile team means that you understand your role and make sure that you are playing the right part in the team. Also, it means that you will work with the team to solve problems in a coordinated way, rather than working alone.
